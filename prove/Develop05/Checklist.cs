// class Checklist : Goal
// {
//     //Provide for a checklist goal that must be accomplished a certain number of times to be complete. Each time the user records this goal they gain some value, but when they achieve the desired amount, they get an extra bonus. For example, if you set a goal to attend the temple 10 times, you might get 50 points each time you go, and then a bonus of 500 points on the 10th time.
